## How do I set up a 10 man?
- Type `!setup` in chat

## How do I change levels?
- `rcon_password mlg` in console
- `rcon changelevel name-of-level-you-want` in console

## I don't know the name of the level
- Go to the [level list] 
- Go to the page for the level you want
- Use the ending string of digits in the link as the level name

Example: for `steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=125689526` you'd do `rcon changelevel 125689526`

## Can I donate?
- I don't mind paying for it all myself (costs about $0.50 per 10-man) but if you'd like to chip in you can send money to `@Tucker-Kolpin` on Venmo

## How do I startup the server?
- Create an account at [DatHost](https://dathost.net/)
- Give me (TOAST BOMB) the email address you used for the account so I can give it access
- Once you have access you should be able to click the profile icon in the top right and see `tckolpin@gmail.com` as an option in the resulting dropdown
- Click `tckolpin@gmail.com` and you should go to the server dashboard
- Click `Start`

**Please remember to stop the server when you are done. If you do forget the server will auto shutdown after 30 min of being empty**

## How do I download demos?
- Follow [How do I startup the server?](#how-do-i-startup-the-server?) to get an account with server access
- At the server dashboard click `Edit`
- Go to `File Manager` 
- Demo files will be in the root csgo folder, they have crazy looking names
  - Demo names are formatted like this `auto-YYYYMMDD-hhmm-map.dem`
  - Newest demo should be at the bottom of the list
  
**[WARNING] - Demos will be deleted automatically after 14 days**

## How to connect to mumble
- Download mumble [here](https://www.mumble.info/downloads/)
- Opening mumble will bring you to a server list, click "Add New.."
- Enter server information like this...
```
Address: hellacharisma.mumble.com
Port: 7975
